This repo is filled with codewars challenges aka (Kata), push at least 5 solutions every week.

## Disclaimer

Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until you have completed it yourselves or at least took the time to think about your own approaches.

I will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo.

**CODEWARRIORS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT MY SOLUTIONS AS THEIR OWN!**

## How It's made

**Technology used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Start my day with solving a CodeWar!

## Optimizations 
I regularly enhance my code by refactoring it, whether it's for improved efficiency or better readability.

## Lessons Learned 
In dealing with this never-ending stream of questions, I've realized that the most significant lesson is acknowledging that there's always room for improvement. It's perfectly fine to not have an answer to a question, as long as you're willing to take the necessary steps to enhance your knowledge.
